# WIP intro-to-ember-workshops

This repository will hold presentations that others may use and adapt to teach Ember.js!

Source material for inspiration is this [Ember.js in 60 mins](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sezqSmxkxo9EmBNpdD76VCTKQtztfO0qS5cGdixRMNw/edit?usp=sharing)
talk, which may be used without restriction aside from those placed on the Ember branding (logos etc)
by Tilde.io.

The goals are to slowly move from slide decks in proprietary formats into an Ember app instead,
possibly using [ember-present](https://github.com/gavinjoyce/ember-present)
